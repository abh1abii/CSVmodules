# CSVmodules
This repository contains modules I custom designed for my use-cases and automations that facilitated modifying, querying, running analysis and filtering logs. These modules are application specific but the algorithms can be used as a reference for similar applets.

# KPI Module.py
This module takes a Command Line argument filename and processes it. Creates a CSV file named out.csv in the same directory as the script file.
